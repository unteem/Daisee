Project: DAISEE - Decentralized Autonomous Interconnected Systems for Energy Efficiency
DAO for smart grids
Smart contract for transactions between an energy producer and a consumer. 
If I produce more than I consume, I can sell my energy (through a token equivalent to Watt/Hours). 
If I produce more than I consume, I can buy energy from a producer in the network

Problem It does not compile.

Our goal with this smart contract is to do a small demo of a situation of exchange in the context of a hackaton.
